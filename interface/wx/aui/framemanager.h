/**
    @class wxAuiManager

    wxAuiManager is the central class of the wxAUI class framework.

    wxAuiManager manages the panes associated with it for a particular wxFrame,
    using a pane's wxAuiPaneInfo information to determine each pane's docking
    and floating behaviour.

    wxAuiManager uses wxWidgets' sizer mechanism to plan the layout of each
    frame. It uses a replaceable dock art class to do all drawing, so all
    drawing is localized in one area, and may be customized depending on an
    application's specific needs.

    wxAuiManager works as follows: the programmer adds panes to the class,
    or makes changes to existing pane properties (dock position, floating
    state, show state, etc.). To apply these changes, wxAuiManager's
    Update() function is called. This batch processing can be used to avoid
    flicker, by modifying more than one pane at a time, and then "committing"
    all of the changes at once by calling Update().

    Panes can be added quite easily:

    @code
    wxTextCtrl* text1 = new wxTextCtrl(this, -1);
    wxTextCtrl* text2 = new wxTextCtrl(this, -1);
    m_mgr.AddPane(text1, wxLEFT, "Pane Caption");
    m_mgr.AddPane(text2, wxBOTTOM, "Pane Caption");
    m_mgr.Update();
    @endcode

    Later on, the positions can be modified easily. The following will float
    an existing pane in a tool window:

    @code
    m_mgr.GetPane(text1).Float();
    @endcode

    Note: The default behaviour of wxAuiManager is to hide panes when they
    are closed and not destroy them, as this allows the loading and saving of
    perspectives to function. This is contradictory to the behaviour of wxAuiNotebook
    which by default destroys pages on close.   


    @section auimanager_layers Layers, Rows and Directions, Positions, Pages

    Inside wxAUI, the docking layout is figured out by checking several pane
    parameters. Five of these are important for determining where a pane will
    end up:

    @li Direction: Each docked pane has a direction, Top, Bottom, Left, Right,
        or Center. This is fairly self-explanatory. The pane will be placed in
        the location specified by this variable.
    @li Position: More than one pane can be placed inside of a dock. Imagine
        two panes being docked on the left side of a window. One pane can be
        placed next to another. In proportionally managed docks, the pane
        position indicates its sequential position, starting with zero. So, in
        our scenario with two panes docked on the left side, the top pane in
        the dock would have position 0, and the second one would occupy
        position 1.
    @li Row: A row can allow for two docks to be placed next to each other.
        One of the most common places for this to happen is in the toolbar.
        Multiple toolbar rows are allowed, the first row being row 0, and the
        second row 1. Rows can also be used on vertically docked panes.
    @li Layer: A layer is akin to an onion. Layer 0 is the very center of the
        managed pane. Thus, if a pane is in layer 0, it will be closest to the
        center window (also sometimes known as the "content window").
        Increasing layers "swallow up" all layers of a lower value. This can
        look very similar to multiple rows, but is different because all panes
        in a lower level yield to panes in higher levels. The best way to
        understand layers is by running the wxAUI sample.
    @li Page: More then one pane can be docked in the exact same Direction,
        Position, Row and Layer. When this happens a tabbed notebook will be formed.
        Tab position will be decided based on the Page values of the panes with
        those that have a lower value appearing on the left, with 0 being the
        absolute left. By default, pages are not enabled.
		This behaviour can be controlled using the wxAUI_MGR_NB_ALLOW_NOTEBOOKS
		flag as well as EVT_AUI_PANE_DOCK_OVER
        @since 3.1
        You can use the wxHAS_AUI_DYNAMIC_NOTEBOOK define to test if you are on a 
		version that supports the dynamic notebook behaviour.

    @event{EVT_AUI_PANE_MAXIMIZE(func)}

        Triggered when a pane is restored.
    @event{EVT_AUI_PANE_ACTIVATED(func)}

    @event{EVT_AUI_PANE_DOCK_OVER(func)}
        This event is triggered when wxAui is about to create a notebook by docking a pane over another one. You may Allow() or Veto() it explicitly to override the default behaviour defined by the wxAUI_MGR_NB_ALLOW_NOTEBOOKS style flag.
